# 🛡️ Naari Secure – Real-Time Women Safety Ecosystem

Naari Secure is a real-time women safety web application designed to provide **instant emergency response**, **guardian tracking**, and **live situational awareness** when a user is in danger.

## Problem Statement

Despite existing safety features in apps like ride-sharing platforms, **women still face delays, limited reach, and lack of real-time monitoring during emergencies**.  
Most systems:
- Work only inside a single app (like Uber)
- Don’t allow continuous guardian monitoring
- Fail when the phone battery or internet is low

##  Our Solution

Naari Secure provides a **dedicated, independent safety ecosystem** where a woman can trigger SOS anytime and guardians get **real-time updates** instantly.

##  Key Features

###  User Side
- SOS Trigger (One-click emergency alert)
- Live location sharing
- Surrounding audio recording during SOS
- Battery status monitoring
- Travel risk detection

###  Guardian Side
- Live location tracking of the user
- Emergency audio access
- User danger alerts on dashboard
- Real-time status monitoring

##  How It Works

1. User logs in → receives secure JWT token  
2. User triggers SOS  
3. Guardian receives:
   - Live location
   - Battery status
   - Risk alerts
   - Emergency audio access  
4. Emergency actions can be taken instantly

##  Testing & Validation

- APIs tested using **Requestly**
- Secure token-based authentication (JWT)
- Real-time flow testing for SOS and guardian alerts

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **API Testing:** Requestly
